## What do we exactly mean by REST?

In the second article (A conversation about REST with my brother), they talked about the creator of HTTP Protocol, which it was belong to **Roy Fielding** with his teammates. Generally, Protocol means the system of rules and acceptable behavior used at official ceremonies and occasions. So as the guy decribed the REST is an architechural style that built in the world wide web as a provider of resources. 

These resources could be anything, and this will lead us to know that resources could contains a different types of data but all can share the same verbs which is you can get these data from anywhere and post it in somewhere else.

In other words, let simplify what they exactly where talking about these verbs and nouns. Imagine that all the programming languages are sharing the same verb, which is let us say a declaring of a certain variable. However, each of these programming languages used a different nouns (ways) to declare a variable.
For exxample, in javascript as we take that you just need to type either var, let or const to declare a variable:
```
var x = 10;
```
On the other hand, in python the declaration of variable will need only the variable name it self without typing any reserved word before it.
```
x = 10;
```
However, in c++ you have to clarify the type of the variable in order to declare it.
```
int x = 0;
```
And so on,...

***Therefore, that exactly what the concept of HTTP protocol works for as we've mentioned in the previous example.***

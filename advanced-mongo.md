# Advanced Mongo/Mongoose

## Review, Research, and Discussion

### Why would a developer choose to make data models?
**It will make it easier for the developer ti use data modeling in order to integrate a high-level processes could deal with the data structures. It makes the data more readable and understandable for the rest of devs.**

### What purpose do CRUD operations serve?
**Its main purpose is to make a perfect application that deals with the database in the main four ways as the CRUD stand for: Create, Read, Update, Delete, and reach the consumer satisfactions.**

### What kind of database is Postgres? What kind of database is MongoDB?
- **_Postgres_ is a relational table based data structure which must all its value be predefined schema and also it might contain a several tables that would later 'relates' by a forigen key.**
- **_MongoDB_ is a non-relational collection of documents, graphs and pair of key-value, its schema is dynamic, therefore, you can easily leave any value you want empty without worrying about it.**

### What is Mongoose and why do we need it?
**It is an npm moduls that needs to create your app schema and connect it to the database and later you create, delete, update and read you schema.**

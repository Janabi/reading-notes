# Redux Toolkit

**_Redux Toolkit_ is our official, opinionated, batteries-included toolset for efficient Redux development. It is intended to be the standard way to write Redux logic, and we strongly recommend that you use it.**

***It is used to help these three common concerns:***
- Configuring a Redux store is too complicated.
- I have to add a lot of packages to get Redux to do anything useful.
- Redux requires too much boilerplate code.

***We can install the toolkit package by using the following command:***
```
npm install @reduxjs/toolkit
```

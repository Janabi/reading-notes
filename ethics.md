## Ethics in Workspace
### Google employees want a role in evaluating company projects
***Most of the tech companies set some rules that relate to the ethics workspace. For example, we have Google that has this kind of rules. Therefore, Google employees make four specific demands. First, they want the company to create a structure to allow rank-and-file employees to review ethical issues in company projects. Second, they want the company to appoint an ombudsman to oversee the ethics review process, with input from employees over who fills the position. Third, they want a plan to ensure Google is transparent with employees about the purpose of the technology the company is developing, so employees can make informed choices about the ethical implications of the work they do. Fourth, they want the company to publish ethical assessments of their projects, such as Dragonfly, and to communicate regularly with employees about issues of concern.***

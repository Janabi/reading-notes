# Event Driven Applications

## Review, Research, and Discussion
### Why is access control important?
**It is a way to authenticate a certain user to access a certain routes based on the user's role.**

### Describe an application that would need access control.
**Delivery application where there will be three roles of users, which they are the driver, the business owner and the customer, where each one of them has a certain role and can access to routes based on the user's need. For example, the customer will have a roue that make this role asscess to all products from different shops and can select and purchase whatever she/he wants.**

### What is a role used for?
**Used to make sure which route and CRUD methods are used for this role.**

### Why is role based access control more scalable than discretionary or mandatory access control?
**The role access control is more scalable because it is easier to create a user with certain role and the role could be upgraded later without any issue.**
